= Shortcuts and Color Schemes =

You can import and export shortcuts and syntax highlighting settings using the commands under Tools, Options, Import Export. This allows PyScripter users to share shortcuts and syntax highlighting settings. If you have customized these settings to match those of popular IDEs and editors such as Visual Studio and IDLE, you are encouraged to submit them to pyscripter@google.com. A repository of such submitted settings is available here.

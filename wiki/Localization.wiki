= Localization =

PyScripter uses [http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ gettext] for creating localizing the user interface. The files that contains the strings be translated is located in the directory:

C:\Program Files\PyScripter\locale
assuming that PyScripter is located at C:\Program Files\PyScripter\.
There are two files of interest to translators in that directory:
  * default.po
  * languages.po

The first contains the strings of PyScripter and the second the localized names of different languages.
To create a translation for a new language:
  # Create a new directory  C:\Program Files\PyScripter\locale\##\LC_MESSAGES\
     In this path, ## represents the two-letter [http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php ISO 639-1] language code.
  # Copy the two po files in that directory
  # Translate the two files using a gettext editor. [http://www.poedit.net/ Poedit] is the recommended editor.
  # Compile the po files to mo files (Poedit can do that) and you are set. Use the View Menu to change the language and test your translation.
  # Please submit your translation files to pyscripter@gmail.com for inclusion in the next PyScripter distribution.

*Tip:* Use the translation memory of Poedit to speed up the translation process.

Note: For compatibility with Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, this PyScripter version 
requires the latest C++ Redistributable Package.  This is automatically installed 
by Python 2.6 and Python 3.0.  If you do not have any of these versions installed, 
then you need to download and install it manually from
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2.

Versions later than 1.8 contain support for remote debugging.  Read 
http://pyscripter.googlepages.com/remotepythonengines for details.  
Please note that to use remote debugging you need to download and 
install the Python package Rpyc version 2.6, available for download from
http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/downloads/list. (highly recommended).

To install rpyc, unzip the downloaded file into the lib\site-packages 
subdirectory of the Python distribution. Repeat this for each version 
of Python you're interested in using.

Please visit http:\\pyscripter.googlepages.com for information about
remote debugging and other PyScripter related topics.

Also if you are using a 64bit version of Windows note that PyScripter will only
work if a 32bit version of Python is installed.

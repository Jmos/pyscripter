Copy the included files to the PyScripter installation folder overriding existing files.  
Please note that to use remote debugging you need to install the Python package Rpyc which is available at http:\\rpyc.sf.net.

You can read about remote debugging at http:\\pyscripter.googlepages.com\remotepythonengines

If you upgrade from a version earlier than 1.8.5 you will need to change the PyScripter shortcuts, since now command line 
arguments are prefixed by double dash ("--"), eg "PyScripter --PYTHON25".

This version is compatible with Python v3.0a2 and later. For "all user" installations of the Python alphas 2.6 and 3.0 you 
may have to manually copy the Python dll to the C:\Windows\System32 since this is not done by the installer.
Please read http:\\pyscripter.googlepages.com\python3.0support if you plan to use PyScripter with Python 3.0.
